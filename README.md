# THIS IS SPACETOY

## Stories
1. As Devin I would like to have a CI system that will automatically deploy things for me so that I don't have to do it
    1. Acceptance Criteria:
    
       * [ ] git repo → build → deploy without manual steps
    2. Things we need:
    
       * [ ] Hosting (we're thinking heroku)
       * [ ] git repo (public github)
       * [ ] ci (travis?)
